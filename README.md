# 97Runner
A brief build log of my "Barn Find" 1997 3rd Generation Toyota 4Runner 


I came accross this 4runner for sale about 2 hours away from my house and instantly went to purchase it. I had been looking for a worthwhile 3rd gen 4Runner for months and nothing had as solid of a frame as this one had, but it was still quite a rough starting point.

Over the course of my ownership I had to:

-Replace front lower ball joints 
-Replace front brake rotors and pads
-Flush and replace all fluids
-Replace entire exhaust from headers back
-Replace belts and filters
-Strip, repaint and refinish all 4 wheels
-Paint correct and Ceramic Coat entire vehicle
-Replace seals on all windows, including front windshield
-Replace all halogen bulbs with LED
-Un-sieze and rebuild rear windshield motor
-Strip entire frame of surface rust and old oil spray, recoat with rust converting primer and rubberized undercoating spray
-Strip and repaint front bumper
-Install aftermarket driving/fog lights
-Remove headliner and carpet, deep clean and dye black
-Replace leaky fuel filler neck
-Replace handbrake assembly 
-Repair/replace interior components like cupholders
-Remove dash, replace bulbs with LED's and restore plastic 
-Repair interior clock diode


It took a lot of work but eventually the vehicle looked like this:

Which isnt a bad look when it started off like this:
